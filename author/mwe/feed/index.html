				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, Portcullis are running a USB Scavenger Hunt at <a title="EMF Camp" href="https://www.emfcamp.org/">EMF Camp</a>. For those of you attending, we&#8217;ve written this post to give you all the instructions and rules you need to get underway. Good luck!<span id="more-4620"></span></p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>This is a cross between a scavenger hunt and a CTF event. Each USB key will contain a puzzle which has to be solved, giving the location of the next USB key. These puzzles aren&#8217;t security specific, so anyone technically minded should be able to take part. If you&#8217;d like to participate, come along to the <a title="Portcullis Village" href="https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Villages:Portcullis">Portcullis Village</a> and we&#8217;ll point you towards the first location.</p>
<p>Please note: These USB keys are not guaranteed to be safe! The team before you may have left all sorts of nasties on there. Please use sensible precautions, as you would when plugging any unknown device into your computer.</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Please don&#8217;t remove the USB keys from their locations, or move them from where you found them. This will ruin the fun for others!</li>
<li>Once you find a USB key, copy the contents off before you start working on the challenge.</li>
<li>Please don&#8217;t alter the contents of the USB keys.</li>
<li>Have Fun!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problems?</h2>
<p>If you have any issues, think something is wrong, or just need some help, please come and find us at the village!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Team has updated its <a title="SSL Good Practice Guide" href="https://portcullislabs.github.io/download/SSLGPG-1.2.pdf">SSL Good Practice Guide</a> to incorporate the recent Heartbleed attack.<span id="more-4359"></span></p>
<p>In case you&#8217;ve been out of the loop, here&#8217;s a brief summary of the vulnerability:</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Heartbleed (AKA CVE-2014-0160) is an implementation flaw in TLS heartbeats for OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through to 1.0.1f. It exposes an unpredictably addressed 64KB chunk of server process memory for each malformed heartbeat received. By performing multiple heartbeats, you can recover almost all of the server process&#8217; memory. Basically, the heartbeat acts as an echo request, with the payload size and payload contents determined by the requester. Typically these are filled with a few bytes of data. However by putting in a payload of say, 1KB with a payload size of up to 64KB, the server will return 63KB of its own memory due to a lack of bounds checking.</p>
<h2>What does it expose?</h2>
<p>Heartbleed can expose anything stored in the server process&#8217; memory, which may contain but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Session tokens</li>
<li>Form submissions</li>
<li>Email addresses</li>
<li>Usernames</li>
<li>Passwords</li>
<li>Private keys</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the server&#8217;s private key is exposed, then all future traffic encrypted by this key can be intercepted and manipulated by anyone holding the key.</p>
<h2>Who/What is affected?</h2>
<p>Any application using OpenSSL/libssl version 1.0.1 through to version 1.0.1.f. This means both <strong>server</strong> and <strong>client</strong> are susceptible to this attack. The scope of this extends beyond just HTTPS- <strong>any service using TLS can be affected</strong>. This bug has existed in OpenSSL&#8217;s code for two years, and at this time there is evidence to suggest that this weakness has been exploited as far back as November 2013.</p>
<h2>What should we do?</h2>
<p>The remediation for this vulnerability is fairly straightforward, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update OpenSSL to version 1.0.1g, or recompile with
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">-DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS</pre>
</li>
<li>Revoke the certificates for any services which have ever been vulnerable. This is important, otherwise the potentially compromised certificates and keys will continue to work</li>
<li>Get new certificates</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have reason to suspect that your service may have been attacked then it would be prudent to suggest that all users change their passwords, as they may have been compromised.</p>

From today onwards the Team recommend only TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2. Up until now the Team have accepted the need for SSLv3 and TLSv1 for compatibility reasons, however the time has come to cut the cord. The loss of compatibility should only affect legacy systems. If these systems cannot be updated to support the newer protocols, then weak SSL is likely to be the least of your security concerns!<span id="more-3444"></span></p>
<p>The Team will continue to update the guide going forwards, and will highlight major changes on the blog. Whilst you&#8217;re checking out our <a href="/whitepapers/ssl-good-practice-guide/" title="updated recommendations">updated recommendations</a>, why not take a few extra minutes and look at our <a href="/whitepapers/ssl-certificate-good-practice-guide/" title="SSL Certificate Good Practise Guide">SSL Certificate Good Practise Guide</a>?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As it stands, SSL is in a bad way. First BEAST, then CRIME, followed by weaknesses highlighted in the RC4 cipher which was proprosed as a workaround to the previous attacks have left SSL version 3 and TLS version 1 in a bind. At present, the most practical recommendation is to use RC4 as the only cipher on SSL3 and TLS1 connections. This is far from ideal, given that RC4 is a weak cipher, and vulnerable to a bias attack.<span id="more-2315"></span></p>
<p>In fact, this recommendation has drawn some criticism from within the Labs Team itself. Some feel that given that BEAST is mitigated in most web browsers, it is better to eliminate RC4 altogether, and rely on the browsers&#8217; protections to prevent BEAST. However, the counter claim to this notes that the Internet is larger than just the web, as well as the fact that BEAST is easier to exploit than the bias attack. Of course, neither of these solutions are viable in the long term.</p>
<p>Slowly, things are changing. This week, the latest version of the last of the major browsers gained default support for TLS v1.2 (see <a title="Transport Layer Security" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Web_browsers">here</a>). These aren&#8217;t the current release versions, but it does mean that support for the majority of users is on the horizon. With this in mind, The Team will start the countdown clock on its current SSL recommendations.</p>
<p>After 01/04/2014 (no joke), the Team&#8217;s SSL recommendations will no longer juggle flaky ciphers and suggest iffy workarounds, but instead will recommend TLS versions 1.2 and 1.1 and with them the glut of new ciphers offered. Hopefully these new recommendations (and their implementation by our customers) will result in fewer issues identified on tests, as well as settling yet another internal debate!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a number of ways to own a webapp. In a shared environment, an attacker can enumerate all the applications accessible and target the weakest one to root the server and with it all the webapps on the box. To try and emulate this approach on a pentest, we have to find ALL THE VHOSTS.<span id="more-2216"></span></p>
<h2>Key features</h2>
<p>This natty python 2 script scrapes a series of web applications (including bing and yougetsignal&#8217;s database) and looks at <a title="Subject Alternative Names" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name">Subject Alternative Names</a> in the SSL certificate to find as many web applications which resolve to an IP address as possible. No guarantees are made as to the completeness or accuracy of the data, but it&#8217;s the best we can do. It can give an insight into the attack surface associated with a given IP address, allowing testers to advise client in situations where the risk is out of their control.</p>
<h2>Usage and example</h2>

<h2>Key features</h2>
<p>This handy little python 2 script does whois lookups on the IP addresses given in a file (one per line), and will give you the range and owner of each of the addresses (with duplicates removed) so you can spot anything that looks fishy <em>before</em> you start testing*.</p>
<h2>Usage and example</h2>
<p>IP address file:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
8.8.8.8
8.8.8.9
4.4.2.2
</pre>
<p>And to run:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ python2 whoislikeaboss.py ips
8.0.0.0 - 8.255.255.255 Level 3 Communications, Inc.
4.0.0.0 - 4.255.255.255 Level 3 Communications, Inc.
</pre>
<p>Simples!</p>
<p>*- Common sense not included.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, there has been a lot of media buzz about <a title="Mailpile" href="http://www.mailpile.is/" target="_blank">Mailpile</a>, a new startup which has raised over $100,000 on IndieGoGo for its eponymous locally hosted web mail project. Having been present at the talk at which this project was officially launched at OHM 2013, I was surprised to see the media&#8217;s reaction to the project. Mailpile appears to have garnered almost universal acclaim for its security features, and praised for its goal of &#8220;Rescuing email from the cloud&#8221; (the name of the presentation given at OHM 2013, slides can be <a title="Rescuing E-mail from the Cloud" href="http://www.mailpile.is/files/OHM2013%20-%20Rescuing%20e-mail%20from%20the%20cloud.pdf">found here</a>). I diagree with the media&#8217;s praise for this project, and here&#8217;s why&#8230;<span id="more-1231"></span></p>
<p>In their presentation, the Mailpile developers stated the concerns with cloud email to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The centralisation of email storage, making mass surveillance trivial</li>
<li>Poor spam filtering</li>
<li>Lack of innovation with regards to F/OSS solutions</li>
<li>Mass encryption is a &#8220;distant dream&#8221;</li>
<li>Proprietary lock-in</li>
<li>Risk of EEE tactics (Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish)</li>
<li>Spam filters being used for censorship</li>
<li>Incompatibility with encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>I happen to agree with each of these issues (perhaps excepting spam). However, in the wake of PRISM, maybe we should even expand this problem space. Metadata is a big deal: It reveals (in a best case scenario) who you&#8217;ve been talking to and when, how long your messages are, and if you include attachments. Why can&#8217;t we protect this data too? Granted, this would require a somewhat more radical solution,  but I don&#8217;t see why this is a problem that couldn&#8217;t be solved. Still, it&#8217;s not fair to judge Mailpile on the basis of problems it doesn&#8217;t aim to solve, so I&#8217;ll discount this for the rest of my post.</p>
<p>What Mailpile propose is yet another mail user agent. Mailpile&#8217;s killer feature in the presentation appeared to be the search functionality, returning genuinely impressive search results in mere milliseconds. Beyond this, the interface was vaguely reminiscent of GMail, though obviously still in a very early stage of development. So, a nice interface, but it still doesn&#8217;t seem to address what I believe is the key issue surrounding web mail: Centralisation. From a pragmatic standpoint, no matter how simple it is to employ GPG, the standard user will not opt for it. Therefore, in my mind, the easiest way to raise the barrier to mass surveillance (the hot button topic right now) is to decentralise the storage of email, something which Mailpile fails to address.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take each of the problem bullet points, and see if Mailpile offers a solution. Mailpile at least partly addresses the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of innovation with regards to FOSS solutions &#8211; Does Mailpile count as innovation? That&#8217;s a matter of opinion</li>
<li>Proprietary lock-in &#8211; Mailpile somewhat addresses this. If one interface supports multiple back-ends, users will find it easier to move between them</li>
<li>Risk of EEE tactics (Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish) &#8211; Mailpile partly addresses this, much for the same reasons as above</li>
<li>Incompatibility with encryption &#8211; Mailpile solves this problem! A locally hosted client is ideal as a solution for this problem</li>
</ul>
<p>So, out of 8 issues identified with cloud email, Mailpile fully solves 1, and partly addresses 3. What of the other 4?</p>
<ul>
<li>The centralisation of email storage, making mass surveillance trivial</li>
<li>Poor spam filtering</li>
<li>Mass encryption is a &#8220;distant dream&#8221;</li>
<li>Spam filters being used for censorship</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these, excepting mass encryption, are really server side problems. Mailpile couldn&#8217;t hope to solve these. So, what would? Spam filtering seems to be already solved &#8211; numerous crowd-sourcing solutions exist, and in my mind this is the right way to go about solving this problem. The decentralisation of email storage just relies on more people running mail servers, and not relying on one of the big cloud providers.</p>
<p>The relative complexity of installing, configuring and maintaining an email server puts many off &#8211; this is what web mail really offers the average user. In my mind, the solution lies in a mail server that&#8217;s simple to deploy and maintain. Decentralising the infrastructure is what will negate the majority of the evils of web mail, not another web mail client, no matter how timely the marketing is.</p>
<p>On Mailpile&#8217;s own web page, they have quotes from articles on their product. These come from Wired, TechCrunch, Boing Boing, and Crowdfund Insider. These large publications should have done their homework before praising Mailpile&#8217;s security, as it does not appear to address the problems it aims to solve. It is my belief that the majority of Mailpile&#8217;s funding has come off of the back of such positive press, some of which is completely unwarranted.  It&#8217;s nice to see a positive reaction to a product with the aim of improving security and privacy for end users, but next time can we actually make sure it delivers on these goals first?</p>
